LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
x
x2
y1
y2


Constructor
	public LinearEquation(double x,double y)


Methods
calculateSlope()
(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
Takes x1 x2 y1 and y2 as parameters and calculates the slope.
Divides y2-y1 by x2-x1
Stores result in double slope
return slope as a double
Stores y2-y1 as numerator
Stores x2-x1 as denominator

CalculateYIntercept
Takes x1 and y1 and plugs it in b= y-mx
m is the slope
solves for b
returns y=numerator//denominator+b
distanceBetweenPoints
x1 x2 y1 y2 used
(x2-x1) use Math.pow()
(y2-y1) use Math.pow()
add x after it gets squared and y after it gets squared
use Math.sqrt() to find square root
return the result as a double

toString
creates a new String that contains the information.
Information is x1 y1, x2 y2, slope, y intercept and distance

findYWithOnlyX
takes the 3rd x value and plugs it into y=mx+b
