LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
x
x2
y1
y2
yIntercept
x3
y3
slope
distance


Constructor
	public LinearEquation(int x,int y)
	public LinearEquation(int x)


Methods
calculateSlope()
(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
Takes x1 x2 y1 and y2 as parameters and calculates the slope.
Divides y2-y1 by x2-x1
Stores result in double slope
return slope as a double
use Math.round((slope*100.0))/100.0) to round to nearest hundredth
Stores y2-y1 as numerator
Stores x2-x1 as denominator

CalculateYIntercept
Takes x1 and y1 and plugs it in b= y-mx
m is the slope
solves for b
returns y=numerator//denominator+b

distanceBetweenPoints
x1 x2 y1 y2 used
multiply differenceOfX and differenceOfY by themselves
add x after it gets squared and y after it gets squared
use Math.sqrt() to find square root
return the result as a double

toString
creates a new String that contains the information.
Information is x1 y1, x2 y2, slope, y intercept, distance, Slope Intercept form equation

findY3WithOnlyX
takes the 3rd x value and plugs it into y=mx+b
m and b are already known
solves for y3
